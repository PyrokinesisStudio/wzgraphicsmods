What is here?  Stuff for making videos.

WZGM has a video dump function ( hotkey F11 toggles on/off ) that
dumps video frames in-game to the $(configdir)/videodumps directory.

The frames are dumped as raw PPM files for speed reasons.  You can
convert them to AVI using the ppm2avi utility here.

For ease of use, you can symlink ppm2avi into your bin dir with
something like this:

		  ln -s `pwd`/ppm2avi ~/bin

Notes: the `` marks around pwd are back-ticks, not quotes.  I have a
bin dir in my home dir where I keep personal utilites, but you can
link the utility into anywhere in your PATH.

The video dumper writes frames in the format wz2100_SCENE#_FRAME#.ppm
where the numbers range from 001-999.


wzencode.py

requires  ffmpeg, python

converts WZ videodump files (ppm format) to video.
output format depends on output file extension
video dump filenames are wz2100_SCENE_FRAME.ppm where
SCENE and FRAME are 3 digit numbers with leading zeros.
example:  wz2100_001_001.ppm  for scene 1, frame 1.

run   wzencode --help  for info

options that are the same as ffmpeg
-b bitrate		 default: 200k bits/second
-s size wxh		 default: same as WZ resolution
-r output framerate		default: 25 fps

encode specific options
--ifr input frame rate.  default: 10
--basename wz2100_
--scene NNN		scene number.  default: 001

encode scene output_file
