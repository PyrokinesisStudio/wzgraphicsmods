What is here?  Stuff for making videos.

WZGM has a video dump function ( hotkey F11 toggles on/off ) that
dumps video frames in-game to the $(configdir)/videodumps directory.

The frames are dumped as raw PPM files for speed reasons.  You can
convert them to AVI using the ppm2avi utility here.

For ease of use, you can symlink ppm2avi into your bin dir with
something like this:

		  ln -s `pwd`/ppm2avi ~/bin

Notes:  the `` marks around pwd are back-ticks, not quotes.  I have a bin dir
in my home dir where I keep personal utilites, but you can link the utility into anywhere in your PATH.

The video dumper writes frames in the format wz2100_SCENE#_FRAME#.ppm
where the numbers range from 000-999.
